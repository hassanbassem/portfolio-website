                <p>Hi, I’m Hassan — a web developer who cares about both clean code and meaningful design. 
                    With a background in Engineering and a love for simplicity, 
                    I specialize in building custom websites that feel powerful, user-friendly, 
                    and tailored specifically to your business. <br><br>
                    I focus on e-commerce, local businesses, freelancers, 
                    and startups — helping them stand out online with carefully 
                    built websites (no templates, no shortcuts, no AI-generated fluff). 
                    My process is built around clear communication, authenticity, and market research, 
                    so the final product actually solves your business challenges.</p>
