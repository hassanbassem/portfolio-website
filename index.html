                        responsive layouts for all devices, animations, and SEO best practices. 
                        Everything is tested thoroughly to make sure your site works seamlessly across browsers and devices.</p>

                    <p>Once everything is approved and ready, your site goes live! I handle deployment, connect domains, 
                        and make sure performance and security are in place. 
                        After launch, I can also provide training and ongoing support to keep your site growing with your business.</p>
